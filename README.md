## Oggrok
A file analyser specialising in the [Ogg Opus](https://opus-codec.org/) format.

Try it [here](https://misterzeus.github.io/Oggrok/).

## Rough Spec

You should be able to pick an Opus file off your hard drive and load it into your browser to peek at what's inside it.
The file's tree structure should be made apparent i.e. the Ogg packets and their settings, the Opus-to-Ogg mapping headers, and the Opus data within the Ogg payloads.

Perhaps Oggok should go to the extra effort of parsing the Opus packet headers, to show further what's going on with the compressed audio contained in them.

The hierarchy of the data is:
- File and its summary data (size, MIMEtype, number of Ogg packets)
- Ogg packet, with its headers and lacing values
- Ogg lacing value payloads
- Opus frames and their headers
